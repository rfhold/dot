description: Scrutinize all changes against existing codebase patterns
---

Scrutinize every aspect of the current changes.

Spawn two explore tasks to start:
1. Run `git status` and identify new features and the components they belong to
2. Identify component boundaries and the patterns that were pre-existing prior to the changes from `git status`

After both tasks complete, spawn an explore task for each component identified and scrutinize the changes vs how the codebase had patterns prior to the changes.
