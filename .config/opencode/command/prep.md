description: Write the current session plan to a document for later reference
---

Capture the plan developed during this session into a detailed markdown document for future reference.

1. Review the full conversation to identify the plan, decisions made, tradeoffs considered, and any open questions.
2. Write a comprehensive markdown document that includes:
   - A clear title summarizing what the plan is for
   - An overview/summary section
   - Detailed steps or phases with enough context that someone (or you in a future session) could pick it up and execute
   - Any decisions made and their rationale
   - Open questions or unresolved items, if any
3. Choose a short, descriptive kebab-case filename that reflects the plan's subject matter.
4. Save the document to `.opencode/plans/<name>.md` in the project root. Create the `.opencode/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist.
5. Output the path where the plan was saved and stop. Do NOT continue with implementation or any other action. Wait for further instructions.
