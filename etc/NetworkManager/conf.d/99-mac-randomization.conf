[connection]
# Use stable MAC per-network (consistent across reconnects to same network)
# - Hides your real hardware MAC address
# - Same MAC for same network (DHCP leases work, captive portals remember you)
# - Different MAC for different networks (harder to track across locations)
#
# Alternative: "random" for new MAC every connection (maximum privacy, may break captive portals)
